## Description

I developed a multi-threaded JavaFX Weather Application, leveraging my programming skills and passion. This application provides users with real-time weather information and forecasts for locations of their choice. The project consists of three main scenes, each offering distinct features and functionality:

### Start Scene

- Users begin by entering their desired location to retrieve weather information.

### Main Scene

- After inputting the location, the application transitions to the Main Scene.
- This scene offers the following features:
  - **Current Weather Data:** Users can instantly view the current weather conditions, including temperature, wind speed, and other relevant information.
  - **Detailed Weather Data:** A button allows users to access more comprehensive data for the current weather. This includes the capability to convert temperature units and wind speed for user convenience.
  - **Daily Forecast:** Users can access a daily weather forecast for the current day.
  - **Return to Start:** A convenient button allows users to return to the initial location input screen.
 
### Weekly Forecast Scene
 - **Weekly Forecast:** The application provides a 7-day forecast, offering detailed insights into upcoming weather conditions.
   
## Technologies Used

- **JavaFX:** The graphical user interface framework that facilitated the creation of an interactive and visually appealing interface.
- **Weather Data API:** To fetch real-time and forecasted weather data for the specified location.
- **Java Programming:** Utilized Java to create the backend logic for data processing and user interactions. The application is multi-threaded, enhancing its performance and responsiveness.

## Key Achievements

- Developed a user-friendly and intuitive application for accessing weather information.
- Implemented dynamic features such as unit conversion and in-depth weather analysis.
- Implemented dynamic backgrounds that change based on the weather condition and local time.
- Efficiently integrated external weather data sources to provide accurate and up-to-date information.
- Showcased strong problem-solving and programming skills by creating a multi-scene JavaFX application.

This project demonstrates my skills in Java and also highlights my ability to design and develop applications that provide valuable information in an accessible and engaging manner. It showcases my dedication to delivering functional and aesthetically pleasing software solutions to meet user needs.
