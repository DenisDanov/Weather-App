Description:
I developed a JavaFX Weather Application, leveraging my programming skills and passion for weather analysis. This application provides users with real-time weather information and forecasts for locations of their choice. The project consists of three main scenes, each offering distinct features and functionality:

- Start Scene: Users begin by entering the location for which they want to retrieve weather information.
- Main Scene: After inputting the location, the application transitions to the Main Scene.
This scene offers the following features:
Current Weather Data: Users can instantly view the current weather conditions, including temperature, wind speed, and other relevant information.
Detailed Weather Data: A button allows users to access more comprehensive data for the current weather. This includes the capability to convert temperature units and wind speed for user convenience.
Daily Forecast: Users can access a daily weather forecast for the current day.
- Weekly forecast scene:
The application provides a 7-day forecast, offering detailed insights into upcoming weather conditions.
Return to Start: A convenient button allows users to return to the initial location input screen.
- Technologies Used:
JavaFX: The graphical user interface framework that facilitated the creation of an interactive and visually appealing interface.
 Weather Data API: To fetch real-time and forecasted weather data for the specified location.
Java Programming: Utilized Java to create the backend logic for data processing and user interactions.
- Key Achievements:

- Developed a user-friendly and intuitive application for accessing weather information.  
- Implemented dynamic features such as unit conversion and in-depth weather analysis.  
- Efficiently integrated external weather data sources to provide accurate and up-to-date information.  
- Showcased strong problem-solving and programming skills by creating a multi-scene JavaFX application.
- This project not only demonstrates my proficiency in Java and JavaFX but also highlights my ability to design and develop user-centric applications that provide valuable information in an accessible and engaging manner. It showcases my dedication to delivering functional and aesthetically pleasing software solutions to meet user needs.
